My Java code for a phone app

This code demonstrates my ability to work in Java using proven testing techniques from basic white box testing to the more complicated black box testing techniques. Unit testing, boundary testing, and equivalence testing, are three of the tests I performed. 
I did not write a main class, as it was not part of the instructions, but, I did try to make sure I had code coverage.
